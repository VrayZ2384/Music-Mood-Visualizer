# Music Mood Visualizer

## Overview

The Music Mood Visualizer is a multi-modal Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) project that utilizes generative AI and Python, along with the PyTorch framework. This innovative system analyzes audio data from music and generates customized images and videos that match the mood of the song.

## Features

- Analyzes audio data from a given YouTube link.
- Automatically determines the mood of the song (Happy, Sad, or Neutral).
- Generates images and videos that reflect the song's mood.
- Customizable prompts allow users to influence the generated visuals.
- Enhances creative content for musicians, content creators, and social media influencers.
- Demonstrates the potential of AI in creative applications.

## How it Works

1. **Input**: Users provide a YouTube link to a song they want to analyze.

2. **Mood Analysis**: The system extracts audio features from the song to determine its mood (Happy, Sad, or Neutral).

3. **Visual Generation**: Based on the mood, the system generates images and videos that match the song's emotional tone. Users can also provide prompts to customize the visuals.

4. **Output**: Users receive stunning visuals that complement their music, ready to be used in various creative projects.

## Technical Skills and Tools Used
